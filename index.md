# Welcome to the Sudbring Wedding information page!

We are excited to share this special day with our friends and family! We know that planning a trip for a wedding halfway across the country can be a daunting prospect. This page is to help ease that burden as much as possible. The information contained within the website are examples and snapshots in time of when we looked up the rates. Upon booking these rates may be different.

This information isn't gospel, so feel free to choose a transportation and hotel that best meets your needs.

We look forward to seeing you in October of 2023!
